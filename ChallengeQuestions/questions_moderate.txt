1.) Count the number of trailing zeros in n! - p 163
    E.g. 5! = 120 has 1 trailing zero

2.) Node structure has next and prev to pointers to Node type
    and a value field to hold the value of the node.
    Convert the binary tree to,

               4
              / \
             /   \
            2     5
           / \     \
          /   \     \
         1     3     6
        /
       /
      0

      to

      0 <-> 1 <-> 2 <-> 3 <-> 4 <-> 5 <-> 6

      // The solution we came up with is inorder traversal,
      // need to check though
